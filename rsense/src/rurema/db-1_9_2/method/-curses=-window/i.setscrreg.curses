--- setscrreg(top, bottom) -> bool
Set a software scrolling region in a window.
+top+ and +bottom+ are lines numbers of the margin.

If this option and Curses::Window.scrollok are enabled, an attempt to move
off the bottom margin line causes all lines in the scrolling region to
scroll one line in the direction of the first line.  Only the text of the
window is scrolled.
