--- subsec -> number

Returns just the fraction for <i>time</i>.

The result is possibly rational.

   t = Time.now        #=> 2009-03-26 22:33:12 +0900
   "%10.9f" % t.to_f   #=> "1238074392.940563917"
   t.subsec            #=> (94056401/100000000)

The lowest digit of to_f and subsec is different because
IEEE 754 double is not accurate enough to represent
the rational.
The accurate value is returned by subsec.
